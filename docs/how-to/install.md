# Installation instructions

*For the time being, only select researchers provided with a Google Drive link can download the Logion desktop application.*

After you access the Google Drive folder via a link provided by a Logion team member, follow these instructions to download and install the application:

1. Hover to the version of Logion corresponding to your device's operating system.
    1. `logion-win` is for Windows.
    1. `logion-mac` is for MacOS.

1. Click the **â‹®** icon and select **Download** from the drop-down menu. This downloads the application .zip file.

1. When the download finishes, go to your **Downlaods** folder and double-click the Logion .zip file. This unzips the application into a new folder.

1. Inside the resultant folder, double-click the Logion application to open and install Logion on our system.

If your institution restricts installation on devices, you may need to contact your IT administrator to temporarily enable installation permissions on your device.
