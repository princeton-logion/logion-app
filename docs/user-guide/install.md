# Installation instructions

*For the time being, only select researchers provided with a Google Drive link can download the Logion desktop app.*

After you access the Google Drive folder, follow these instructions to download and install the app:

1. Hover to the version of Logion corresponding to your device's operating system.
    1. `logion-win` is for Windows.
    1. `logion-mac` is for MacOS.

1. Click the "**â‹®**" icon and select **Download** from the drop-down menu. This downloads the app .zip file.

1. When the download finishes, go to your **Downloads** folder and double-click the Logion .zip file. This unzips the app into a new folder.

1. Inside the resultant folder, double-click the Logion app to open Logion on your system.

    - If running on Windows, you may receive saying "Windows Protected Your PC." Click **More info** and then click **Run anyway**.

If your institution restricts installations, you may need to contact your IT administrator to temporarily enable installation permissions on your device.
