Logion is an open source, no-code desktop app designed to assist philologists using language models.
With Logion, researchers can use a suite of [premodern Greek language models](https://huggingface.co/princeton-logion) to aid
philological research tasks, such as error word detection and gap filling. Logion runs on
personal computers without access to high performance computing (HPC) resources. We hope to make an HPC version available in the coming months.

## Installation
Logion runs on both Windows and MacOS.

We hope make the app publicly available for download through our website soon.

For those with access to the project's private Google Drive:
see the [installation guide](./user-guide/install.md) to install Logion on your device.

## Requirements
Logion requires no outside software or dependencies.

## Acknowledgements
Logion is developed through collaboration with Princeton University Research Computing and Classics.
