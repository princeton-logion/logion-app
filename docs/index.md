Logion is an open source, no-code desktop app designed to assist philologists using state-of-the-art language models.
With Logion, researchers can download a suite of premodern Greek language models for conducting
philological research tasks, such as error word detection and gap filling. Logion is designed to be run on
personal computers without access to high performance computing (HPC) resources.

## Installation
Logion runs on both Windows and MacOS.

We hope to soon make the app publicly available for download through our website.

## Requirements
Logion requires no outside software or dependencies.

## Acknowledgements
Logion is developed through collaboration with Princeton University Research Computing and Classics.
