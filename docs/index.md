Logion is an open-source, no-code application designed to assist philologists using state-of-the-art language models.
With Logion, researchers can download a suite of pre-modern Greek language models for conducting
philological research tasks, such as error word detection and gap filling. Logion is designed to be run on
personal computers without access to high performance computing (HPC) resources.
