# Logion

An open-source, no-code language modeling tool for pre-modern Greek philology.

## Description
Logion provides provides a no-code user interface through which scholars may obtain suggestions for common classical philological research tasks, such as text restoration and scribal error detection. In this way, Logion empowers classical philologists to leverage advances in artificial intelligence to assist their reserach. Logion is designed to be run on personal computers without access to high performance computing (HPC) resources.

## Installation
Logion is currently available for Windows and macOS. Users may download Logion from the [Logion project website](https://www.logionproject.princeton.edu/). Application documentation may be found [here](https://princeton-logion.github.io/logion-app/).

## Requirements
Logion has no outside software dependencies. For more information on Logion's capatibility with your personal machine, see Logion's [hardware documentation](https://princeton-logion.github.io/logion-app/hardware/).
