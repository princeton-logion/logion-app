# Logion

An open source, no-code language modeling tool for premodern Greek philology.

## Description
Logion provides provides a no-code user interface through which researchers may obtain suggestions for common classical philological research tasks, such as text restoration and scribal error detection. In this way, Logion empowers classical philologists to leverage advances in AI to assist their research. Logion is designed to be run on personal computers without access to high performance computing (HPC) resources.

## Installation
Logion runs on both Windows and MacOS.

At the moment, only select researchers may download the app during its test phase.

We hope to make the app available for public download from the [Logion website](https://www.logionproject.princeton.edu/) in the coming months. Users may read the app [User Guide](https://princeton-logion.github.io/logion-app/).

## Requirements
Logion requires no outside software dependencies.

For more information on Logion's compatibility with your personal computer's hardware, see Logion's [hardware guide](https://princeton-logion.github.io/logion-app/hardware/).
